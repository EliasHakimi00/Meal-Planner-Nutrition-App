## Description
As a team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We also continued to learn about agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively. We implemented feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

We have written our own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help us as a team to stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project as a means to track the status of our project tasks helped us to understand the benefits of Kanban boards.*[1]*</a>
